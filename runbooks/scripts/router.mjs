//
// WHAT IT REPLACES. index.mjs distinguishes PULLED procedures (a slug routes you: you
// already know you are deploying the app) from PUSHED standards and references (nothing about the
// task says "read powershell.md first", so their purpose has to ride the index or they never fire).
// That pushed block reached 5.9KB in EVERY session, paid whether or not anything matched.
//
// A prompt is the thing that decides relevance, and SessionStart does not have one. So this runs on
// UserPromptSubmit, asks one Jev call whether each pushed runbook applies, and injects the matches.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-22 (a one-call match probe): 67 runbooks as
// 67 Nouls in one call, 883ms, $0.0004. Self-eval over 12: 9/12 top-1, 12/12 in top-3, narrowing 67
// to a mean of 3.8. On "the nightly backup pruned nothing again" it returned exactly one hit.
//
// ⚠ FAIL LOUD, NOT FAIL OPEN. Changed 2026-09-22, and the old rule was the exact opposite, so read
// this before restoring it. No key, no network, a timeout, a bad response, a thrown error: every
// path injects a three-line notice that says routing is unavailable, says why, and says to read
// the runbooks folder directly. It used to emit the full index instead.
//
// WHY IT FLIPPED. That full index is 31,957 bytes, about 8,000 tokens, against the roughly 7,000
// the always-on arrangement this router replaced cost. So the fallback was more expensive than the
// problem, and one transient timeout wiped out a day of routing savings. The old rationale was that
// silently hiding a standard because an API blipped is worse than never having had the router. The
// notice answers that directly: nothing is hidden silently, the gap is named and the reader is told
// where to look, for about 250 bytes. Do not put the full-index fallback back.
//
// The single deliberate exception is a prompt under 12 characters, which injects nothing. That is
// not a failure, it is a continuation ("ok", "yes") inside a session that already routed the real
// task, and it is the difference between saving 35% of the old block and saving 89%.
//
// RETRY, ADDED 2026-09-22. A call costs about $0.0002, so a retry is free in money and expensive in
// the only currency that matters here: the user is sitting in front of their prompt waiting for it.
// So the bound is a total wall-clock budget, not a per-attempt timeout, and only the failures that
// could plausibly answer differently on a second try are retried at all. See TOTAL_BUDGET_MS and
// isRetryable below.
