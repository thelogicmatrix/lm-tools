// Compress a mailbox window into tags, so code can query what only prose held.
//
// A cheap judgement model like Jev fits two jobs: surfacing candidates in a body too large to read,
// and compressing many semi-structured fields into a few typed tags. This is the second, and the
// stronger of the two: many semi-structured fields reduced to a few typed columns. An email's subject and snippet carry meaning no column holds, so
// nothing downstream can filter on it. Eight nouls turn each message into eight numbers that sort,
// group and go in a WHERE clause.
//
// ⚠ THIS SENDS EMAIL CONTENT TO A THIRD PARTY (OpenRouter, then TypeSafe). Sender, subject and
// snippet leave the machine. That is fine for the author's own mailbox, an explicit
// decision made on 2026-09-22. It is NOT fine for anything with work or customer data in it, per AGENTS.md:
// customer PII never leaves the machine. The tag mode reads a pipe and cannot know which mailbox
// it came from, so check what you are piping in. The search mode runs postman itself, so it knows
// the identity and refuses `work` (the work mailbox) in code before anything is read or sent. A
// search over work mail stops at `postman search`, run by hand.
//
// Usage:
//   python postman.py inbox <identity> --days 30 --json | node jevmail.mjs      (tag a window)
//   node jevmail.mjs --in window.json --json tags.json
//   node jevmail.mjs --ask "<plain-English ask>" --identity <id> --query "<gmail query>"
//   node jevmail.mjs --ask "<plain-English ask>" --identity <id> --from <addr|domain> [--days N]
//       [--top 5] [--json hits.json]                                             (search)
//   node --test jevmail.test.mjs
//
// Search narrows first, server-side: --query runs `postman search` (X-GM-RAW, the newest 40 hits,
// Date, From, Subject and URLs but no body), --from runs `postman inbox --from --json` (one
// sender's slice, with a 2000-character text snippet). Then one Jev call per message scores the
// message and each of its links and passages against the ask, and prints a ranked shortlist.
// Jev generates no text, so it picks among the parts it is shown and never writes an answer.
//
// Deliberately NOT a generic engine. One chunker that knows what an email is, questions written
// out below. The generic version was specced (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-22-jevchecker-design.md)
// and dropped until a second real sweep exists to extract it from: every chunker strategy in that
// spec was a guess, and guessing structure before measuring is exactly what went wrong with the
// job-board scoring coefficients the same day.

// eight do not name, add a ninth rather than reading around it.

  //
  //   is_automated: 'an automated or no-reply message rather than one a person wrote'  → fired 97%
  //   needs_reply:  'asks the applicant a question or requests an action from them'    → fired 92%

  // failure: a tag that fires on almost everything cannot filter anything, and 352 messages came
  // back tagged both automated and needing a reply, which is a contradiction no downstream query
  // can act on.
  //
  // The fix in both cases is to make the RARE case the firing case, and to name the concrete
