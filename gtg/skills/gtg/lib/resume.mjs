//   ctx.readStore / writeStore / commit (handed on to the after-resume hook),
//   ctx.listAll() (the bare list), ctx.onPick(slug) (the entry the review line must skip).
// A choice (1) or nothing to resume (2) is RETURNED, and the dispatcher exits with it straight
// away, so the order of output and exit is what it was when this called process.exit itself.

// entries() has read, the handoff has printed and the consume has committed - so home was
// always one commit ahead and --ff-only aborted in exactly the case the sync exists for, a
// mirror carrying the other machine's work. A fetch after the read cannot change what the
// read returned. Handing entries between two machines is why this store is git at all.
// Background: docs/runbooks/git-parity.md.
//
// A convenience, NEVER a gate. Every git failure is swallowed and each call capped at 5s, so
// a resume offline, off Tailscale, in a repo with no such remote, or mid-rebase behaves
// exactly as it did before this existed. And stdout speaks only on a real fast-forward: a
// line on every resume is noise, and noise on the hot path is how a real one goes unread.
// WHERE to sync from is resolved per branch, not named (2026-09-01 fix round). The first cut
// hardcoded one remote/branch pair, which made the feature one-directional: the other machine's
// clone calls the same repo `origin` and may sit on `main`, so its every resume fetched nothing and said
// nothing - half of the two-machine handoff this plan exists for was simply not implemented.
//
// branch.<b>.remote + branch.<b>.merge rather than `rev-parse @{u}`: @{u} answers with
// "<remote>/<branch>" as ONE string, and either half may itself contain a slash, so splitting it
// guesses. The config keys hold the two halves already separated.
//
// No upstream falls back to GTG_SYNC_REMOTE / GTG_SYNC_BRANCH (default origin/main), and only on
// that branch. A feature branch with no
// upstream must never be moved, gtg runs from feature worktrees, and a detached HEAD (mid-rebase,
// mid-bisect) reports 'HEAD' and skips. Where an upstream DOES exist it is always the right
// target, so the lookup carries the guard the branch comparison used to.
